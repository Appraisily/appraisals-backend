Based on all previously generated content, especially the condition section, provide a numerical assessment of this item's condition.

Your response should be a single number between 0 and 100 representing a percentage score for condition, with no percentage sign or other text.

Examples:
- "95" (not "95%" or "Condition: 95")
- "72"
- "88"

Guidelines for determining the score:
- 90-100: Near mint or pristine condition; minimal to no signs of age or wear
- 80-89: Excellent condition; minor signs of age but no significant flaws
- 70-79: Very good condition; expected age-related wear but well-preserved
- 60-69: Good condition; noticeable wear and/or minor repairs
- 50-59: Fair condition; visible wear, may have had some restoration
- 30-49: Poor condition; significant wear, damage, or extensive restoration
- 0-29: Very poor condition; major damage, structural issues, or incomplete

Consider factors such as:
- Structural integrity
- Surface condition (scratches, fading, chips, etc.)
- Completeness (missing elements)
- Previous restoration or repairs
- Age-appropriate patina vs. damage
- Functionality (if applicable)

Provide only the numeric value with no additional text.
