Based on all previously generated content, assess the rarity of this item compared to similar pieces in the market.

Your response should be a single number between 0 and 100 representing a percentage score for rarity, with no percentage sign or other text.

Examples:
- "70" (not "70%" or "Rarity: 70")
- "45"
- "93"

Guidelines for determining the score:
- 90-100: Extremely rare; museum-quality uniqueness; possibly the only known example
- 75-89: Very rare; seldom appears on the market; limited production or survival
- 60-74: Rare; uncommon but occasionally available; limited production run
- 40-59: Somewhat uncommon; can be found with effort; moderate production numbers
- 20-39: Common; regularly available on the market; mass-produced
- 0-19: Very common; abundant availability; mass-produced in large quantities

Consider factors such as:
- Number of similar examples known to exist
- Production volume (limited edition vs. mass-produced)
- Survival rate (how many have been preserved)
- Special characteristics that distinguish this from more common examples
- Availability on the current market

Provide only the numeric value with no additional text.
