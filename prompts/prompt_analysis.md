# Appraisals Prompt Analysis

## Overview
This document provides an analysis of the prompt files in the `appraisals-backend/prompts` directory. Each prompt has been evaluated for its purpose, quality, and potential overlaps with other prompts.

## Consolidated Metadata Prompt

**File:** `consolidated_metadata.txt`

**Purpose:** Generate a comprehensive JSON structure containing all metadata fields for an appraisal item.

**Assessment:**
- Well-structured with clear instructions and guidelines
- Comprehensive, covering all aspects needed for a complete appraisal
- Detailed requirements for each field
- Strong formatting instructions for JSON output

**Potential Improvements:**
- Significant overlap with many individual field prompts
- Could be streamlined if it's used alongside individual field prompts

- Focuses on analyzing provided auction results
- Requires complete sale details and comparisons with the appraised item
- Emphasizes using only provided data without fabrication
- Overlaps with consolidated metadata's justification field

## Overall Assessment and Recommendations

### Identified Issues

1. **Significant Overlap:** The consolidated metadata prompt contains all the fields that are individually defined in separate prompt files.

2. **Potential Inconsistencies:** Using both the consolidated prompt and individual prompts could lead to inconsistent outputs, particularly for fields split across multiple files (age1, age2, age_text, conclusion1, conclusion2).

3. **Redundancy:** Multiple files contain similar instructions that are duplicated across prompts.

4. **Unclear Workflow:** The relationship between the consolidated prompt and individual prompts is not clearly defined in the documentation.

### Recommendations

1. **Consolidation Strategy:** Consider one of these approaches:
   - Use only the consolidated metadata prompt for all fields
   - Use individual prompts but remove their overlap from the consolidated prompt
   - Clearly document which approach should be used in which scenarios

2. **Standardization:**
   - Ensure consistent formatting and requirements across all prompts
   - Standardize example formats
   - Maintain consistent categorization for item types (artwork, antique, collectible)

3. **Documentation:**
   - Add clearer documentation about how these prompts are intended to work together
   - Update the README to clarify the relationship between prompts
   - Document the workflow for prompt usage

4. **Modularization:**
   - Consider a more modular approach where base prompts can be combined with specific instructions
   - This would reduce duplication and make maintenance easier

5. **Field Consolidation:**
   - Consider consolidating related prompts (e.g., merge age1.txt, age2.txt, and age_text.txt into a single age.txt)
   - Create clearer boundaries between different fields to reduce overlap

6. **Versioning:**
   - Implement a versioning system for prompts to track changes and improvements
   - Document which prompt versions are compatible with each other
