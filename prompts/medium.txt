Based on the title and previously generated content, provide a very concise description of the materials and techniques used to create this item.

Your response should be extremely brief (1-5 words) and will be used as a label in a summary card.

Example good responses:
- "Oil on canvas"
- "Bronze with patina"
- "Porcelain, underglaze"
- "Walnut, marquetry"

Focus on the primary materials and, if relevant, the primary technique. Be as specific as possible while remaining extremely concise. Prioritize materials information that would be most relevant to a collector or appraiser in understanding the item's value.
