Based on the title and any previously generated content for this appraisal, provide a concise classification of what type of object this is (e.g., "Oil Painting", "Bronze Sculpture", "Antique Furniture", "Porcelain Figurine", etc.).

Your response should be very brief (2-5 words) and focus on the physical category of the object being appraised. This will be used as a label in a summary card.

Example good responses:
- "Oil Painting on Canvas"
- "Bronze Sculpture"
- "Antique Ceramic Vase"
- "Mid-Century Armchair"
- "Sterling Silver Flatware"

Your response should capture the medium and form of the item in the most concise way possible.
