Based on all previously generated content, especially sections related to valuation, market analysis, and the auction data if available, estimate the current market demand for this type of item.

Your response should be a single number between 0 and 100 representing a percentage score for market demand, with no percentage sign or other text.

Examples:
- "85" (not "85%" or "Market demand: 85")
- "50"
- "92"

Guidelines for determining the score:
- 90-100: Extremely high demand; readily sells at or above estimate; multiple competitive bidders
- 75-89: Strong demand; consistent sales with occasional bidding competition
- 60-74: Moderate demand; sells reliably but may take time to find the right buyer
- 40-59: Average demand; can sell but may require marketing and patience
- 20-39: Low demand; difficult to sell, likely below estimate
- 0-19: Very low demand; extremely niche market or outdated style

Consider factors such as:
- Recent auction performance for similar items
- Prominence/popularity of the artist or maker
- Current collecting trends
- Historical performance of similar items
- Seasonal factors if relevant

Provide only the numeric value with no additional text.
