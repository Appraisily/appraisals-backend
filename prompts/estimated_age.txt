Based on the title and previously generated content (especially the age analysis sections), provide a concise estimate of when this item was created.

Your response should be very brief (2-5 words maximum) and will be used as a label in a summary card.

Example good responses:
- "Circa 1920"
- "18th Century"
- "1950-1960"
- "Tang Dynasty"
- "Contemporary (2015)"

Use the most appropriate time format based on the precision of the dating:
- For precisely dated works: year or year range
- For approximate dates: "Circa" followed by year
- For period pieces: century or dynasty
- For contemporary works: "Contemporary" with year if known

Be concise but informative, favoring clarity over excessive precision when dating is uncertain.
