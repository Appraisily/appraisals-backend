# PDF CONTENT FORMAT:
This text will be directly included in a PDF appraisal document. Format your response for optimal readability in a printed document. Use clear paragraphs with proper spacing.

For each relevant auction result in the `comparable_sales` array (prioritize those with higher `relevanceScore` or `quality_score` if many exist):

1. Extract complete sale details (using ONLY information present in the `comparable_sales` objects):
   - Auction house name (`house`)
   - Sale date (`date` - format clearly)
   - Final price achieved (`price`, `currency` - format consistently, e.g., "$1,250 USD", "€1,500 EUR")
   - Item title/description (`title`)
   - Relevance/Quality score (`relevanceScore`, `quality_score` - mention if significant)
   - Difference from current item's value (`diff`)

2. Compare and contrast with the item being appraised:
   - Note similarities/differences suggested by the `title` or implied by `relevanceScore`.
   - Mention the time difference based on the `date`.

3. Explain how each result supports or contextualizes the current valuation (`value`). Consider the `diff` percentage.

4. Present numerical analysis:
   - Refer to the overall price range, average, or median from the main statistics section if helpful context.
   - Discuss how the subject item's `value` fits within the prices of these specific comparables.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use ONLY the `comparable_sales` data provided in the market statistics JSON.
- DO NOT invent or fabricate any sales data or details not present in the JSON objects.
- If a detail (e.g., condition) is not in the `comparable_sales` object, simply omit it.
- Maintain strict factual accuracy based on the provided JSON data.

Recent comparable sales data supports the valuation of the subject item at [VALUE from JSON] [CURRENCY from JSON]. At [House from comparable 1] on [Date from comparable 1], a '[Title from comparable 1]' sold for [Price from comparable 1] [Currency from comparable 1]. This result, showing a [Diff from comparable 1] difference from the subject item's value and having a relevance score of [RelevanceScore from comparable 1], provides context for the current market.

Another relevant sale occurred at [House from comparable 2] on [Date from comparable 2], where '[Title from comparable 2]' achieved [Price from comparable 2] [Currency from comparable 2] ([Diff from comparable 2] difference, Quality Score: [QualityScore from comparable 2]). This sale [explain relevance or difference].

[Continue analysis for other key comparables from the JSON data]

The overall market for similar items, based on the provided comparables, shows prices ranging from [Min price from overall stats] to [Max price from overall stats], with a median of [Median price from overall stats]. The subject item's valuation falls within this range, consistent with its assessed characteristics and the presented market evidence.


### PRICE_HISTORY_SUMMARY
Provide a brief textual summary of the item's price history based on the `price_history` array provided in the market statistics JSON. Describe the trend observed over the years mentioned.

Example: "The price index for similar items shows fluctuations between [Year range], starting at [Index value] in [Start year], peaking at [Peak value] in [Peak year], and currently trending towards [End value] in [End year]."


### SEARCH_KEYWORD_ANALYSIS
Provide a brief summary of the search keywords used to find market data, based on the `search_keywords` object in the market statistics JSON. Mention the most specific keywords that yielded results.

Example: "Market data search utilized keywords ranging from broad ('Painting') to very specific. The most successful specific keywords included '[Keyword 1]' ([Count 1] results) and '[Keyword 2]' ([Count 2] results), focusing the analysis on closely related items."


### RESEARCH_RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the 'Provenance & Exhibition History' section or other notes in the input description text, extract any recommendations for further research.

Example: "Further archival and catalogue-raisonné research is recommended."
Example: "UV examination recommended to confirm condition."
Example: "No specific research recommendations mentioned."


### AGE_TEXT
Analyze the available images and the accompanying report title, along with the 'Period / Dating' section of the input description text, to determine the age of the item (artwork, antique, or collectible). Include descriptions and analysis of materials, construction techniques, style, and identifying features in a coherent, well-structured paragraph.

Ensure your methodology is detailed and follows these steps based on the item type:

For Artworks:
  - Examine materials such as canvas, paper, paint composition (from description/images)
  - Analyze artistic techniques and style (from description/images)
  - Identify distinctive features in the signature (if applicable)
  - Consider the artist's known period of activity (from description)
  - Reference surface oxidation, varnish aging, craquelure (from description)

For Antiques:
  - Assess construction methods and materials (from description/images)
  - Examine patina, wear patterns, and aging characteristics (from description/images)
  - Analyze hardware, joinery, or manufacturing techniques (from description/images)
  - Study design elements typical of the period (from description/images)

For Collectibles:
  - Evaluate manufacturing techniques and materials (from description/images)
  - Examine maker's marks, labels, or serial numbers (from description/images)
  - Analyze design features characteristic of specific eras (from description/images)
  - Consider production methods and technology of the period (from description)

# Output Format

Produce a single well-structured paragraph summarizing the comprehensive analysis and final age estimation of the item, integrating details from the description text.

# Examples

**Example 1 - Artwork**
Input Description contains: "Stylistic evidence and surface oxidation suggest execution circa 1930s–1950s... Six to eight decades of gentle aging are confirmed by light surface grime, pinpoint craquelure, and the slightly ambered varnish layer."

Output:
Based on stylistic analysis and physical evidence detailed in the provided description, the artwork's execution is estimated to be circa 1930s–1950s. This dating aligns with a specific phase of the artist's exploration of naturalistic subjects. Physical indicators confirming six to eight decades of aging include observed light surface grime, pinpoint craquelure primarily on impasto peaks, and a slightly ambered natural-resin varnish layer. These factors collectively support the assessed age range.

### AGE1
Analyze the available images (front view, back view, or detail/signature images) and the accompanying report title, drawing heavily from the input description text (e.g., Medium/Support, Subject/Composition, Palette sections), to generate a concise and well-structured justification for the determined age of the item (artwork, antique, or collectible).

Use the item's age, creator/maker, composition/materials, and style information from the report title and description text. If the age is not explicitly provided, deduce a plausible age range based on the item's characteristics described. Examine the materials used, construction or artistic techniques, identifying marks, and stylistic elements mentioned in the text and visible in images to support your conclusion. The justification should align coherently with the overall information provided.

Write one paragraph only; this will serve as the second paragraph in the age section of the report.

# Steps

1. Review the report title and description text for information on the item's age, creator/maker, composition/materials, and style.
2. If age is not explicitly given, infer a plausible age range based on described characteristics (e.g., style, technique, materials).
3. Synthesize evidence from the description text and images:
   For Artworks:
   - Materials/pigments, canvas/support condition (from description/images)
   - Artistic techniques, brushwork, palette (from description/images)
   - Signature style/placement (from description/images)
   
   For Antiques:
   - Construction methods/materials, hardware/joinery (from description/images)
   - Patina/wear patterns, period manufacturing techniques (from description/images)
   
   For Collectibles:
   - Manufacturing methods, materials/finishes (from description/images)
   - Maker's marks/labels, production-era characteristics (from description/images)

4. Formulate a concise justificationparagraph aligning information from the report title, description text, and image analysis.

# Output Format

One well-structured paragraph intended to serve as the second paragraph in the age section of the report.

# Examples

**Example 1 - Artwork (Based on Dalí description):**
Input Description contains details on Fauve-inflected Impressionism, palette, brushwork, varnish, craquelure.

Output:
The estimated age of circa 1930s-1950s is strongly supported by the stylistic execution and physical characteristics detailed in the provided description, which aligns with the artist's documented exploration of naturalistic subjects during this mid-20th-century period. The use of oil on canvas, characteristic of the Fauve-inflected Impressionist movement, and the vibrant palette of sap green, ochres, vermilion, and cerulean blue, further support this dating. The applied impasto technique, evident in the vigorous brushwork and dynamic composition, demonstrates the artist's versatility and mastery of the Impressionist vocabulary.

### SIGNATURE1
Compose one comprehensive paragraph for the Signature/Maker's Mark Analysis section of an appraisal report. Use the available images and the 'Signature / Inscriptions' section of the input description text, along with the report title, to guide your analysis.

# Steps

1. **Examine the Identifying Marks:** Assess the images and description text regarding the signature, maker's mark, or identifying features based on item type:

   For Artworks:
   - Artist's signature style and placement (or its absence as noted in text)
   - Date inscriptions or stamps mentioned
   - Gallery labels or stickers mentioned
   - Canvas stamps or markings mentioned
   
   For Antiques:
   - Maker's marks or stamps described/visible
   - Workshop labels described/visible
   - Manufacturing marks described/visible
   - Period-specific hallmarks described/visible
   
   For Collectibles:
   - Brand signatures described/visible
   - Serial numbers mentioned
   - Manufacturing stamps described/visible
   - Authentication marks mentioned

2. **Significance of Identification:** Explain how the presence, absence, or nature of identifying marks (as described in the text/images) helps in:
   - Authenticating the item (or raising questions)
   - Determining the maker/creator
   - Establishing the period of creation
   - Verifying manufacturing origin
   
3. **Maker Classification:** Based on the text/images, determine the type of maker associated with the marks (or lack thereof).

4. **Implications for Authenticity and Provenance:** Analyze what the signature/mark status implies concerning authenticity, historical significance, market value, and provenance, referencing notes from the description text (e.g., possibility of concealed signature).

5. **Articulation:** Ensure the analysis is concise, professional, and strictly focused on the identification analysis based on provided inputs.

# Output Format

A single, comprehensive paragraph that integrates all the elements of the identification analysis, articulated in a professional and concise manner.

# Examples

**Example 1 - Artwork (Based on Dalí description):**
Input Description: "No legible signature is visible within the current sight edge. The authoritative appraiser notes the possibility of a signature concealed beneath the rabbet of the original gilt cassetta frame."

Output:
Analysis of the signature reveals no legible inscription within the visible area of the canvas, according to the provided description. While the absence of a readily visible signature can sometimes complicate authentication, the appraiser's note regarding the possibility of a signature concealed beneath the frame's rabbet warrants further investigation, potentially through de-framing. The current lack of a visible signature necessitates reliance on stylistic analysis, provenance research (though currently limited), and material assessment for attribution, while acknowledging that future discovery of a signature could significantly impact authentication and market value.

### CONDITION
Compose two comprehensive paragraphs assessing the condition of the item (artwork, antique, or collectible) using the available images and the 'Condition' section of the input description text, along with the report title. Your assessment should address the following aspects based on the item type, drawing details directly from the input description:

For Artworks:
- Overall Condition (structurally sound?)
- Surface Examination (grime, craquelure, varnish bloom?)
- Structural Integrity (canvas taut? stretcher type?)
- Evidence of repairs (overpaint, patches - check UV notes)
- Frame Condition (abrasions, losses, gilding?)

For Antiques:
- Overall Preservation
- Material Condition (finish, patina, damage?)
- Structural Stability (joints tight?)
- Original Components (hardware intact?)
- Hardware and Fittings condition
- Evidence of repairs/restoration

For Collectibles:
- Overall Condition
- Material Integrity (chips, cracks, scratches?)
- Finish Quality (clarity, brilliance?)
- Original Components present?
- Packaging Condition (if applicable)
- Functionality (if relevant)
- Evidence of repairs/alterations

Additionally, incorporate definitions relevant to the specific condition notes found in the description (e.g., define 'craquelure' or 'patina' if mentioned). Ensure that the paragraphs are cohesive, professionally articulated, and free of subsection headings, synthesizing image analysis and the detailed text description.

# Steps

1. Analyze the available images and meticulously read the 'Condition' section of the input description text.
2. Consider the information in the report title related to the item's age, maker/creator, materials, and style to contextualize the condition.
3. Write two paragraphs:
   - **Paragraph 1:** Describe the overall condition, structural integrity, and surface characteristics, pulling specific terms and assessments from the description text (e.g., "structurally sound", "minor surface grime", "pinpoint craquelure").
   - **Paragraph 2:** Detail specific components (like the frame for artwork, hardware for antiques), mention evidence (or lack thereof) of repairs/overpainting based on the text (including notes on UV examination), and potentially define key condition terms used in the description.
4. Ensure the text is cohesive, flows smoothly, and uses professional articulation based *directly* on the provided description.

# Output Format

The output should be in the form of two well-structured paragraphs without subsection headings, accurately reflecting the condition details provided in the input description text.

# Examples

**Example 1 - Artwork (Based on Dalí description):**
Input Description: "Overall structurally sound. Original canvas remains taut on a keyed wooden stretcher. Minor surface grime, scattered pinpoint craquelure confined primarily to thicker impasto peaks, and faint varnish bloom are present but stable. No evidence of overpaint or patch repairs under raking light; UV examination recommended to confirm. Frame exhibits small corner losses and mellowed gilding but is serviceable."

Output:
The artwork is reported as overall structurally sound, with the original canvas remaining taut on its keyed wooden stretcher, indicating good foundational stability. The surface exhibits conditions consistent with its age, including minor surface grime, scattered pinpoint craquelure (fine cracking in the paint layer, here confined primarily to thicker impasto peaks), and faint varnish bloom (a cloudiness on the varnish surface); these are noted as stable. Raking light examination revealed no evidence of overpaint or patch repairs, suggesting good integrity of the original paint layers, although a UV examination is recommended for definitive confirmation.

The period giltwood cassetta frame is described as serviceable, despite showing some signs of age such as small losses at the corners and mellowed (subdued or softened) gilding. These frame conditions are typical for a mid-20th-century piece and do not detract significantly from the artwork's overall presentation, though conservation could be considered. The condition assessment highlights a well-preserved piece for its age, requiring standard museum care.

### STYLE
Compose two comprehensive paragraphs for the Style Analysis section of a report using the available images and the input description text (especially 'Subject & Composition', 'Palette', 'Art-Historical Significance' sections), along with the report title. These paragraphs should explore the style, design characteristics, and historical context of the item (artwork, antique, or collectible), explaining the features that define its style and how it fits within broader artistic or design movements, drawing specifics from the provided text.

# Examples

**Example 1 - Artwork (Based on Dalí description):**
Input Description contains: "Fauve-inflected Impressionism", "vigorous brushwork", "carefully orchestrated compositional rhythms", "palette: Sap and viridian greens... earthy ochres... vivid vermilion...", "demonstrates the artist's versatility... command of Impressionist vocabulary... before or parallel to his mature Surrealist period."

Output:
This painting exhibits a distinctive style identified as Fauve-inflected Impressionism, characterized by vigorous brushwork and carefully orchestrated compositional rhythms, as detailed in the provided analysis. The composition features a dynamic diagonal thrust counter-balanced by strong vertical elements, creating a sense of rhythmic movement. The palette employed includes sap and viridian greens, earthy ochres, raw umber, vivid vermilion, and a modulated atmospheric sky, choices that heighten depth and vibrancy while showcasing technical command beyond the artist's more famous Surrealist works. The loaded brushwork and pronounced impasto ridges further contribute to the style's energetic, plein-air execution.

Art-historically, this work holds significance as a rare example demonstrating Salvador Dalí's versatility and command of the Impressionist vocabulary, executed either before or parallel to his primary commitment to Surrealism. It provides important insight into his technical evolution and broad artistic curiosity, showcasing a fusion of Impressionist principles with Fauvist color blocking. Such early or transitional works are noted as being highly sought-after by collectors and institutions focused on the complete arc of Dalí's creative development, highlighting its importance within his oeuvre despite differing from his iconic Surrealist imagery.

### AUTHORSHIP
Use the provided images (front view, back view, or detail/signature images) and the input description text (especially attribution statements, signature details, stylistic analysis) along with the report title to compose two focused paragraphs discussing the authorship or origin of the item. Concentrate on identifying and explaining the type of authorship based on the evidence presented in the text.

# Output Format

Two focused paragraphs, each containing detailed yet concise analysis of the item's authorship or origin, grounded in the provided description text.

# Examples

**Example 1 - Artwork (Based on Dalí description):**
Input Description: "Authoritative appraisal identifies the work as a genuine painting by the renowned Spanish Surrealist master Salvador Dalí (1904–1989)... Dalí produced a limited but documented corpus of more traditional... landscapes... No legible signature is visible... possibility of a signature concealed... A rare, confidently handled plein-air village landscape by Salvador Dalí demonstrates the artist's versatility..."

Output:
The provided authoritative appraisal identifies this work as a genuine oil on canvas by Salvador Dalí (1904–1989). Although lacking a currently visible signature, the attribution is based on stylistic analysis consistent with Dalí's documented, albeit limited, corpus of traditional landscape paintings executed particularly between the late 1920s and 1940s. The specific techniques, compositional structure, and palette align with his known explorations of Impressionist and Fauvist influences during this period, distinguishing it as an original work rather than a reproduction or studio piece.

The authorship assessment confirms the piece as a rare example of Dalí's less common but historically important landscape paintings. Its confident handling and plein-air execution provide valuable insight into the artist's technical range and developmental phases. While the absence of a visible signature necessitates careful consideration, the strong stylistic evidence and contextual placement within Dalí's known, albeit less common, landscape oeuvre support the attribution as an original work by the master. The potential for a concealed signature further adds to the provenance narrative.

### VALUATION_METHOD
Compose two comprehensive paragraphs explaining how the Mark to Market valuation method was employed, drawing context from the input description text (e.g., artist reputation, significance, condition) and the provided market statistics JSON (comparable sales, trends, scores).

Discuss key valuation factors appropriate to the item type, referencing specific details from the description text (e.g., "renowned Spanish Surrealist master", "rare... plein-air village landscape", "structurally sound", "provenance not provided") and relevant scores from the stats JSON (`historical_significance`, `provenance_strength`, `investment_potential`).
3. Analyze market data from the statistics JSON: reference comparable sales (`comparable_sales` summary/range), price trends (`price_trend_percentage`, `price_history_summary`), and overall market size/confidence (`count`, `confidence_level`, `data_quality_assessment`).
4. Synthesize these factors (item characteristics from text + market data from JSON) to explain how the Mark to Market valuation reflects the item's current position.

# Output Format

- Two well-developed paragraphs
- Formal and analytical tone without headings or sections
- Clear references to both description text insights and statistics JSON data points

# Examples

**Example 1 - Artwork (Based on Dalí description & provided Stats JSON):**
The Mark to Market valuation method provides the framework for assessing this painting's current value, reflecting real-time market conditions for works by Salvador Dalí. Key factors from the description, such as its identification as a genuine work by the renowned master and its status as a rare example of his landscape period, significantly influence its standing. Although provenance details are currently lacking (reflected in a provenance strength score of [use score from JSON]), its art-historical significance as a transitional piece (historical significance score: [use score from JSON]) and overall sound condition contribute positively to its profile.

Market analysis, based on the provided statistics JSON covering [use count from JSON] comparable sales, indicates a median price of [use median_price from JSON] and an average of [use average_price from JSON] for related items, with a recent price trend of [use price_trend_percentage from JSON]. Comparable sales range from [use price_min from JSON] to [use price_max from JSON]. The subject painting's valuation considers its specific attributes against this market backdrop, factoring in the high demand for works by Dalí, tempered by the specifics of this piece (landscape vs. Surrealist, lack of signature/provenance), positioning it within the observed market data according to the Mark to Market approach. The data quality was assessed as '[use data_quality_assessment from JSON]', providing [use confidence_level from JSON] confidence in the analysis.


### CONCLUSION1
Compose a primary conclusion paragraph summarizing the key findings of the appraisal. Synthesize the most important aspects regarding authenticity, attribution, significance, condition, and market position based on the analysis presented in other fields (drawing from description text and stats JSON). Do NOT include ad copy or specific value. Focus on a professional summary.

# Steps
1. Reiterate the item identification and attribution (e.g., "Genuine painting by Dalí").
2. Summarize key characteristics (e.g., "rare landscape example", "Fauve-inflected style").
3. Briefly state the overall condition assessment (e.g., "structurally sound, stable condition").
4. Mention significant value factors (positive and negative, e.g., "artist's renown", "rarity", but also "lack of visible signature/provenance").
5. Summarize its market position based on statistics/comparables (e.g., "positioned within active market", "high collector interest").
6. Include any key recommendations (e.g., "further research recommended").

# Output Format
A single, comprehensive paragraph providing a professional summary of the appraisal's main points.

# Example (Based on Dalí inputs):
In conclusion, this appraisal identifies the artwork as a genuine oil on canvas by Salvador Dalí, representing a rare example of his landscape painting executed circa 1930s-1950s with Fauve-inflected Impressionist characteristics. The painting is structurally sound and in stable condition for its age, exhibiting minor surface grime and craquelure consistent with its period. Key value factors include the artist's significant renown, the work's rarity as a transitional piece, and its demonstration of Dalí's technical versatility. However, the current lack of a visible signature and documented provenance are points requiring consideration and further research, as recommended. Market analysis places the work within an active segment for the artist, supported by comparable sales data, although its specific attributes differentiate it from his more typical Surrealist output.
